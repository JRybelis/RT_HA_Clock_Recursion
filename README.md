# RT_HA_Clock_Recursion
## Home task for .Net position solution

### Part 1 - Analog clock arm angle degree finder. Projects:
- RT_HA_Clock.CLI (default starting project)
- RT_HA_Clock.LIB
- RT_HA_Clock.Logic

Takes user input of hours and minutes, calculates the position the clock arms would take for that time. 
Then, determines the degree of the smaller the two arms form.
Prints the result out to the console.

### Part 2 - Hierarchical structure depth finder. Project:
- RT_HA_Recursion.CLI (must be run individually)

Creates a self-referencing object graph. Calculates its maximum depth. 
Prints the result out to the console.
